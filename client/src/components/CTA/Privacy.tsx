            </Typography>

              We won’t, however, delete your posts in Discussions, messages you
              sent to other members, your responses to our tests and surveys,
              log records, and other similar data. We need to keep that data for
              a number of reasons, such as protecting other users’ right of
              freedom of expression, preserving the integrity of our research,
              or ensuring the security of our website, and the retention of this
              data is necessary for us to provide our services to you and
              others.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              If you decide to delete your profile, please make sure you first
              save any information you’d like to keep. Once the profile is gone,
              it’s gone.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              We’ll need to verify the authenticity of any data correction or
              removal request – so please make sure your account is always
              linked to an active e-mail address. We don’t ask you for data such
              as your full name, address, or date of birth – your e-mail address
              is the only real identifier – so if you lose access to the address
              linked to your account, we’ll have no way of verifying you own the
              account.

              (4) How Do We Secure Your Information?
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              We take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to
              prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of your personal
              information. For instance, we store this information on our secure
              (password and firewall-protected) servers, encrypt traffic to and
              from the website, and anonymize or pseudonymize personal
              information where possible.
            </Typography>
            <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
              Still, we can’t guarantee complete security of data sent over the
              internet – for example, someone may discover a vulnerability in
              the encryption protocol that we use, your internet service
              provider may record the data you send, and so on. Please take care
              when posting sensitive data.
