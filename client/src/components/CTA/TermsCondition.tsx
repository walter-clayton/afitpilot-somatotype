            limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages,
            which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In
            these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest
            extent permitted by law.

            makes no representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your

            Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
            warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a
            consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations
            set forth in this section shall be applied to the greatest extent
            enforceable under applicable law.

          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it
            later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are
            required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps
            against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not
            mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent
            us taking steps against you at a later date. For example, if you
            miss a payment and we do not chase you but we continue to provide
            the Products, we can still require you to make the payment at a
            later date.

            effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
            performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
            constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
